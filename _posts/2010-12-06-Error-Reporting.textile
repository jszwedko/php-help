h1. {{ page.title }}

h2. Options that affect error reporting.

* error_reporting
* display_errors

h6. error_reporting

p. See http://au2.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting and http://au.php.net/function.error_reporting
To see all errors, set this to '-1'. To see no errors, set this to '0'.
If you have access to php.ini, set this option there. This can be set using the function specificed about, but it won't have an effect for fatal errors.


h6. display_errors

p. See http://au2.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors
Make sure this is set to *On* to see errors. If you have this set to Off, you won't be able to see errors, even if you have error_reporting set at -1.


*Gotcha*: Make sure that error_reporting isn't being overriden in one of your PHP scripts after being set in php.ini.
*Gotcha*: Apache and the CLI have different php.ini's. Make sure you edit the php.ini specificed by Apache when running phpinfo() through your webserver, not the command line.

h2. How should I set my error reporting?

p. Set them good (AKA I'll write this later).

h2. Help! I still can't see errors!

p. If you're sure you've edited your php.ini, saved it, restarted Apache, and you still can't see errors, come to ##php on freenode and tell them the problem. Tell them you've tried everything listed here to no avail.
